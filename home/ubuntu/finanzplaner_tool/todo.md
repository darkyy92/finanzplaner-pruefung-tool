# Swiss Financial Planner Tool Migration Project

## Project Overview
Migrate the existing Swiss Financial Planner Tool from vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to a modern tech stack:
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Library:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The final built application must function completely offline.

- [x] Define application state interface
- [x] Create type definitions for utility functions
- [x] Define event types for state updates

### 4. State Management Implementation
- [x] Create Context provider for global application state
- [x] Implement customer data state and reducers

- [ ] Add comprehensive type definitions to all calculation functions
- [ ] Verify calculation output matches original code

### 7. Layout & Navigation Components
- [x] Create application layout component (Layout.tsx)
- [x] Build navigation menu component (Navigation.tsx)
- [x] Implement section visibility management
- [x] Create 13th AHV pension toggle component
- [x] Build app header with controls
- [x] Create form action buttons (back, next, calculate)

### 8. Form Components Implementation
- [x] Create base form component with validation support
- [x] Build customer profile form component
- [ ] Build current situation form component
- [ ] Build retirement planning form component
- [ ] Build tax optimization form component
- [ ] Build investment concept form component
- [ ] Build real estate financing form component

- [ ] Build action plan form component
- [ ] Implement form validation logic

### 9. Results & Summary Components
- [x] Create summary box component template
- [x] Build customer profile summary component
- [ ] Build retirement planning results component
- [ ] Build tax optimization results component
- [ ] Build investment concept results component
- [ ] Build real estate results component

### 10. Styling with Tailwind
- [x] Create base style foundations (colors, typography, etc.)
- [x] Style navigation and layout components
- [x] Style form components and inputs
- [ ] Style results display components
- [x] Style toggle switches and buttons
- [ ] Ensure responsive design
- [ ] Implement print styles

### 11. Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect all components to form the complete application
- [ ] Test form submission and data flow
- [ ] Test calculation functions with sample data
- [ ] Verify 13th AHV pension toggle functionality
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test all navigation paths
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works as expected

### 12. Build & Deployment
- [ ] Optimize Vite build configuration
- [ ] Create production build
- [ ] Test production build offline functionality
- [ ] Verify all features work in production build
- [ ] Create detailed README with instructions

### 13. Documentation
- [ ] Document component structure
- [ ] Document state management approach
- [ ] Update any existing documentation to reflect new implementation
- [ ] Create developer guide for future maintenance

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Developing remaining form components
- Migration of calculation functions

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- Set up initial Vite project with React-TypeScript template
- Configure Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
- Create basic project structure with necessary folders
- Set up Vite configuration for offline compatibility
- Initial analysis of the existing codebase structure
- Mapped the data flow between components
- Created TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Implemented state management with React Context
- Created core layout and navigation components
- Implemented the 13th AHV pension toggle functionality
- Created reusable form components with validation
- Implemented the Introduction and Customer Profile sections
- Set up form validation and error handling

## Notes
- All development must ensure offline functionality remains intact
- The migrated application must produce identical calculation results
- Focus on maintaining the same user experience while improving code quality
- Canton Bern calculations and 2025 Swiss financial parameters must remain correct
